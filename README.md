# self-Confidence-and-Trust-Interactive-Decision-Framework
The code of " A Belief-Region Partitioned Framework for self-Confidence and Trust Synergy Towards Utility-Optimal Consensus in Heterogeneous Fuzzy GDM"
"Script" is the root folder of the project. Among them, "manus_deal_allCode.py" is the core code of the algorithm, and other .py files are for drawing and data processing. 

Note that "manus_deal_allCode.py" uses the Python API for Lindo, and the optimization model involves 30 global variables and nearly 100 constraint functions, so the commercial "extended" license is used for processing. 

The Data file contains Chinese dm decision information and a trust-confidence matrix.
